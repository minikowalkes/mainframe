Finite. Failure fells flowers, friends, families.
Empty. Everything emptied. Everybody evacuated.
Despair. Definitely disparaging. Deleted.
Cynical. Critics, cynics. Cryogenic. Cold.
Belated. Bequeathed beneathe boulders.
Anxious. Anxiety acts accelerated.

I have failed. I've failed many times. I've prepared myself to fail again. There's only so many failures, a finite quantity.
I am empty, a stereotypical hollow shell of a human being. Everybody is gone, and I am to blame. Everything is ruined.
I feel despair; a depression the likes of which impress and stress. Despair spawns from regret. Regret is regression.
I am self-centered, selfish, and cynical. Not much has been proven to me to act otherwise. Selflessness does not succeed.
I fell behind. I'd argue it will happen again, but I cannot think such thoughts. Pessimism plagues me and my world.
I am anxious. It's the cause of the thoughts I cannot think. I'm not allowed to, but I do. Paranoia evolves from anxiety.

Anxiety never goes away. It tears away at my body, mind, and soul. 
It has driven me to isolation, failure, and anger. 
It seems as though I never learn from my mistakes. 
If I had, I wouldn't make the same mistakes and expect different results.

It's my fault. It always has been; it always will be.
It's my fault. It's a schism of the psyche.
It's my fault. There's no longer anything I can do.
It's my fault I feel nothing but pain.
I was taught; writing is thought.
