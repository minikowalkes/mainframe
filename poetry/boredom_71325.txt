Well it's official. I'm bored. I haven't allowed myself
to be bored in quite some time. I am finally getting
around to learning RE instead of doin' a bunch of other
stuff. I need more physical activity to keep up and
hopefully reverse some heart damage.

Tomorrow's gonna be a busy one for me. Then the next day,
and the next day, and the NEXT day, and the next day, and
the Next day...     <===     Spongebob quote, lmao.

I'm going to be learning RE on my linux machine, since
for some odd reason, my brain processes linux easier while
laying/propped up in bed. I used to have a gnarly projector
set up as a monitor... but those were the days I suppose.

I always realize too late that being in the moment is 
usually awfully better than dwelling on the past, and
worrying for the future. I just need to stick here -
AURORA BOREALIS, AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, AT THIS TIME OF
DAY, IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY, LOCALIZED ENTIRELY
WITHIN MY KITCHEN.

Got only 5 hours of sleep last night. I need to stop 
programming before bed. But I am drawn to my PC later
on in the day. I need to develop better programming
habits. 

AND BY THAT I DO NOT MEAN FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS. lol.
I still like makin' spaghetti code (:

with a grain of salt. It is an online journal and
functions as a way to flex my creative writing muscles.

PPS: Future employers, Ignore the poetry section
entirely. It is not meant for you lol.

PPPS: Comedy comes in threes, but I'm boutta change
the game right now. Y'all ain't ready for this in
2025.
