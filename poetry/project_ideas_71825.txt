<---   + Anti-AI Rant    --->
So it turns out ChatGPT's API lacks a feature
to bulk-delete previous chats. There's the idea.

You literally have to delete each chat one by one,
which entails loading the entire chat, which wastes
so much of my time. I'm so damn sick of wasting my time.
Getting tired, of standing here...

Once again, yet another valid reason for me
to absolutely hate AI. I finally personalized
my chats to be productive (Any time spent on that platform 
I view as time wasted), but it doesn't help when 
I am constantly bombarded with my clandestine past chats.

It's a regular expression parsing machine that
tells you that you're correct no matter what to 
drive engagement. It's not a tool to be more 
productive, it's a tool to make you dumber and 
sell you things. Humans are great at personification.

Y'know what they used to have? It was this thing
called books that weren't ".pdf" documents. You could 
touch them, smell the bleached paper, the ink,
and write in them with whatever utensil if you so
chose. Let's burn 'em all and set up four walls!

It doesn't help that I feel alone in this. I'm like,
one of the only AI dissenters on planet earth right now.

An ASCII-based cypher for these poems in java.
Shouldn't be that difficult, right? RIGHT!?

<---   Poem   --->
Drowning in an inefficient sea,
Trapped in a digital purgatory.
Severing ties with my past,
Answering questions never asked.
