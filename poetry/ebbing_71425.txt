Short one today. Just getting my last thoughts out
for the evening. Once again, this is an over-glorified
to-do list.

~~~   Priorities   ~~~
1) pygame. time for tutorial hell again.
   It's not like pygame documentation is 
   bad or anything, it's just a lot.

2) gotta work on modern microsoft paint
   for non-AI generated assets. I used to
   be really good at using MSpaint, and 
   I've been meaning to get better at visual 
   art. 2D skill must be mastered prior to 
   moving on to 3D modeling.

3) Why, yes. I have considered a career in
   modeling. Only issue is they denied me
   for being too tall and handsome.

4) Eventually, gotta get back to all those
   aforementioned python modules.
