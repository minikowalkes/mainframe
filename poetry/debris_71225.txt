7/12/25 -> twelve hours later.
Why haven't I been playing bass? It actually really helps with
programming and computational thinking due to its... strange 
improvisational nature. Mistakes are welcomed, and encouraged.
Tactile learning, I suppose. But I totally thought I learned
better via audio. Writing is best! All I wanna do is make notes!

My BP peaked at 160/90 today. My BPM at the time was 101.
After drinking approximately 400 mL of water, eating supper,
and spending some time relaxing, it dropped down to 127/80.
That cycle cannot keep continuing. It will kill me.

I learned a RATM song on bass without a reference.
But tbh, I gotta get ready for bed. I almost fell asleep at
like 7:30 until I was RUDELY INTERRUPTED.
I learned some ridiculous python nonsense without
the aid of "tutorial hell videos," I finally RTFM!

Once again, this is kind of an over-glorified to-do list.
More like a prioritization, but that's neither here nor there.

1) Paperwork. Gotta do all this nonsense paperwork
   for this, that, and the other thing. It takes forever.
   Gotta be patient in order to be a patient, which is stupid.
2) Make some sys scripts. I should be working on Java, but
   I need to get back into the robot 0s and 1s mindset
   shifting bits in registers before I do that.
3) After sys, I suppose I will work on os. Something I read
   suggested that sys doesn't work properly on Windows...?
   I have yet to test it.
4) After os, I suppose I will work on not being so repetitive
   and do pathlib next. After which point...
5) I can focus my efforts on pygame. I'm always busy.
6) Consequently, post steps 1-5, I can finally touch grass.
   And I walk from my machine... And I walk from my machine.
   Good night. --minikowalkes
