<---   Procrastination   --->
My room was spotless 3 days ago. Now I can't walk 
through it without tripping on something. But I'm 
glued to the computer all day to do a bunch of 
stuff and things and whatnot. I'm picking up where I
had left off.

I gotta clean out under my bed for more storage.
It's takin' forever with the order, already.

Going to have to abandon routine for room maintenance.

<---   Recent Habits/Lab Report   --->
>>>800 mL of dihydrogen monoxide introduced to the system 3x daily

>>>10 oz of Coffee(TM) introduced to the system 4x daily

>>>Food administered at regular intervals, 3x daily
   --> unfortunately, meals required approximately 30-45 minutes
   --> regular intervals are actually irregular
   --> possible cause of errata in data

>>>"Self-guided Studying" up to 3hrs daily
   --> must increase time for improved results.
   --> possible cause of poetry... will report back later

>>>Full system submerged in water and sodium lauryl sulfate, low conc NaOH administered 2x daily

>>>Aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex GLY administered to underarms once daily.

>>>Introduced calcium carbonate/flouride anions to oral cavity 2x daily

>>>Full system shutdown for approximately 7.0-7.5 hours.
   --> inconsistent, statistically insignificant at best
   --> possible cause of errata in data
