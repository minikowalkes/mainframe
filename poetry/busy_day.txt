Lots of calls to make today.
Lots of meetings to attend today.
Lots and lots of jets and planes!

I haven't written a haiku in a while, so let's 
see how many rhetorical devices I can shove into
seventeen total syllables.

<---   Haiku   --->
python_programming
parses_personal_process
procedurally.

/*

|  Top that alliteration.
|  Also, a reference to phosphorus.
|  Consider it an allegory, or extended metaphor.
|  Could've done Pb, so let's do another! 
|  I really only like lead because of 
|  PbI_2. That was when I first learned about
|  "crashing out," via experience.
|  I use underscores for subscripts
|  in a non-formattable file format lol.
|  It's not that .txt is NOT formattable, 
|  I just use the github website to write these.
|  And I don't know how to work it well yet.

<---   Haiku   --->
Pedantic butler,
Personally brutalized,
Peanut butter-y.

I've been meaning to write a sonnet,
However, I forgot the "rules" of a 
sonnet. Been a while since I've read
something sonnet-esque, either. Who's
got two thumbs and is going to write 
any poetry in the advent of AI? THIS GUY!!!

<---   Reference   --->
Because I always have to reference some form of 
media in a copyright-infringement-avoidant way:

"One and One make Two, Two and One make Three,
It was destiny."     <===     Jables and RageKage.
It's for entertainment purposes, and it's 
transformative.
