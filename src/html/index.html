      Pretty much just copying this from VScode. I do have my GH attached to VSc,
      but repeated exposure to webdev stuff is better for me. I don't really "think
      like a webdev," I think like a programmer.

      Also, I like the structure I used way back when. This had to have been either
      the late Fall '24, or early Spring '25 when I made this. I was super hyped on
      making a website, until I realized the upkeep costs and domain name prices.

      Once again, not a webdev guy. JavaScript angers me on a spiritual level.
      Out of all "programming/scripting" languages, JavaScript has to be the worst.
      Plus I remember the "good old days" of the internet, where basic HTML and CSS 
      could allow one to retire by 30.
