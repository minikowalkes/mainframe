'''TODO:
   1) Figure out re. Too lazy to do so right now.
   2) Figure out some webscraping nonsense to compare
      the text of each book.
   3) Turning this into part of the regular expression chemistry
      parser turing machine garbage project that's a total dumpster
      fire. Can't stop the unhinged comments in my code lol.
   4) Also going to need some sort of web address search algorithm. 
      Needs to search a few common book re-selling websites.
   5) What's a python?
   6) This is literally just so that I don't waste any money
      on a textbook that I don't need. I literally just want
      to confirm the book, but since they have different covers,
      they have different ISBNs and I can't f***in' see a
      preview of the d**n book. I'm literally going insane.''''

def main():
  isbn_1 = int(input("Enter first ISBN with no dashes:  "))
  isbn_2 = int(input("Enter second ISBN with no dashes:  "))
  if num1 == num2:
    print("Same.")
  else:
    print("Different.")

main()

'''Okay so now we need some sort of webscraper
   to compare ISBN's to actual text present within
   the books so this is garbage and I hate python
   more than life itself.

   'Tis but a scratch.'''
